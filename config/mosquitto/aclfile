# Example device nodes: each device authenticates as its own username (recommended)
# If you want per-device isolation, add `user rpi`, `user pdu-01`, etc. with patterns:
# pattern write grow/tent/%u/sensor/+/+/state
# pattern write grow/tent/%u/actuator/+/+/state
# pattern write grow/tent/%u/status
# pattern read  grow/tent/%u/actuator/+/+/set

# Controller user can issue commands and read states (create in passwords file)
