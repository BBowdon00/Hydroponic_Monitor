- [x] **Integration Testing**: 5 end-to-end test scenarios
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Formatting, analysis, testing, build verification
- [x] **Testing Procedure**: Comprehensive testing documentation and procedures

#### Cross-platform Support
- [x] **Web Application**: Primary platform
- [x] **Android Application**: Native mobile experience

### Features In Flight üöß

#### Manual Reconnect Orchestration (TASK008)
- [ ] `ConnectionRecoveryService` to tear down + reinitialize MQTT & InfluxDB
- [ ] Persistent connection banner UX (green connected state, Wi-Fi icon/refresh affordance with progress indicator + success/partial/failure snackbar)
- [ ] Structured logging + provider state for last reconnect attempt

#### Sensor Page Refresh & Stale Indicator (TASK009)
- [ ] Remove Device Control section from the current Dashboard page and ensure Devices tab remains canonical for actuators
- [ ] Rename Dashboard navigation/tab copy to "Sensor" and update associated routes/tests
- [ ] Surface >60s stale notices directly on sensor tiles (with elapsed time messaging)

#### Historical Data Analytics (Planning)
- [ ] **Time-Series Charts**: Implement fl_chart line charts fed by Influx queries
- [ ] **InfluxDB Queries**: Range/aggregation helpers with graceful fallback when Influx unavailable
- [ ] **Time Range Controls**: UI toggle for 1h / 24h / 7d / 30d windows
- [ ] **Dashboard Integration**: Blend historical trends with real-time sensor tiles

#### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **MJPEG Stress Testing**: Broaden coverage for error/waitingFirstFrame/fullscreen flows
- [ ] **Dynamic Device Discovery**: Add repository/provider cache to seed device lists across sessions
- [ ] **Full-stack Automation**: Playwright suite for critical user journeys
- [ ] **Dashboard Layout Refinement**: Split sensor vs device panels per product feedback

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Known Issues
- **Charts Page Placeholder**: `ChartsPage` currently surfaces placeholder UI; pending historical data implementation
- **Video Stream Testing**: Expand widget/integration coverage for error, waitingFirstFrame, fullscreen scenarios

### Technical Debt Items  
- **Code Documentation**: Some utility functions need more comprehensive inline documentation
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: Widget tests could be expanded for edge cases and error scenarios
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings could be more streamlined

*Note: No blocking issues currently identified. All core functionality operational.*

## Development Metrics (Current)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit / Provider Tests**: Extensive coverage across MQTT repositories, Influx fallback, actuator controls, video state
- **Widget Tests**: Key screens (VideoPage, DevicesPage controls) validated via Riverpod harnesses
- **Integration Tests**: Tagged suites exercise MQTT + video workflows with Docker services (manual opt-in)

### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: All flutter analyze checks passing
- **Formatting**: Consistent dart format applied throughout codebase
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clean Architecture principles maintained
- **Dependency Management**: All packages up-to-date and secure

### Future Roadmap

### Next Development Cycle (Priority Order)
1. Manual reconnect service + dashboard UX polish (TASK008)
2. Historical chart prototype feeding from Influx queries
3. MJPEG stream resiliency tests + automation groundwork
