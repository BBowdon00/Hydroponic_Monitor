### Features In Flight üöß

#### Production Readiness Hardening (TASK012)
- [ ] Remove dummy InfluxDB fallbacks and surface explicit error states across repositories/providers.
- [ ] Update dashboard/video UI to default to "No Data" and highlight service outages.
- [ ] Default MJPEG stream URL to production `.env` value and refresh documentation/tests.

#### Manual Reconnect Orchestration (TASK008)
- [ ] `ConnectionRecoveryService` to tear down + reinitialize MQTT & InfluxDB
- [ ] Persistent connection banner UX (green connected state, Wi-Fi icon/refresh affordance with progress indicator + success/partial/failure snackbar)
- [ ] Structured logging + provider state for last reconnect attempt

#### Settings-Driven Runtime Configuration (TASK010)
- [x] Persist MQTT, InfluxDB, and MJPEG settings with secure credential handling (shared prefs + secure storage)
- [x] Dynamic rebuild/retire of MQTT & Influx services + staged Apply flow
- [x] Settings UI now loads current config, validates input, supports Apply & Reset to Defaults
- [x] Added tests: config repository persistence, dynamic service reconfiguration, video provider URL adoption, runtime reconfiguration integration
- [ ] Future: batch multi-field edits & diff banner warning (non-blocking)

#### Historical Data Analytics (TASK011)
- [ ] **Time-Series Charts**: Build fl_chart line charts per sensor using new Riverpod providers
- [ ] **InfluxDB Queries**: Implement time-series query helper with fallback for 1h / 24h / 7h ranges
- [ ] **Range Controls**: Align Charts page chips with 1h, 24h, 7h options and refresh behavior
- [ ] **UI Integration**: Embed charts within dedicated cards/tiles while preserving stats and accessibility

#### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **MJPEG Stress Testing**: Broaden coverage for error/waitingFirstFrame/fullscreen flows
- [ ] **Dynamic Device Discovery**: Add repository/provider cache to seed device lists across sessions
- [ ] **Full-stack Automation**: Playwright suite for critical user journeys
- [ ] **Dashboard Layout Refinement**: Split sensor vs device panels per product feedback

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Known Issues
- **Charts Page Placeholder**: `ChartsPage` currently surfaces placeholder UI; pending historical data implementation
- **Video Stream Testing**: Expand widget/integration coverage for error, waitingFirstFrame, fullscreen scenarios

### Technical Debt Items  
- **Code Documentation**: Some utility functions need more comprehensive inline documentation
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: Widget tests could be expanded for edge cases and error scenarios
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings could be more streamlined

*Note: No blocking issues currently identified. All core functionality operational.*

## Development Metrics (Current)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit / Provider Tests**: Extensive coverage across MQTT repositories, Influx fallback, actuator controls, video state
- **Widget Tests**: Key screens (VideoPage, DevicesPage controls) validated via Riverpod harnesses
- **Integration Tests**: Tagged suites exercise MQTT + video workflows with Docker services (manual opt-in)

### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: All flutter analyze checks passing
- **Formatting**: Consistent dart format applied throughout codebase
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clean Architecture principles maintained
- **Dependency Management**: All packages up-to-date and secure

### Future Roadmap

### Next Development Cycle (Priority Order)
1. Production readiness hardening (TASK012) ‚Äî remove dummy data, surface service health, align video defaults
2. Manual reconnect service + dashboard UX polish (TASK008)
3. Historical chart prototype feeding from Influx queries (TASK011)
4. MJPEG stream resiliency tests + automation groundwork (TASK007 follow-up)

# Progress

## Recently Completed
- TASK010: Runtime configuration with secure persistence & dynamic service rebuilds (MQTT/Influx/MJPEG) + retire pattern
- Video provider stabilization (avoid notifier disposal churn; idle-only MJPEG URL adoption)
- Connection lifecycle hardening: awaited connected event, retire guards, repository disposal safeguards
- Sensor Page Refresh (TASK009) migration (stale indicator, controls separation)

## In Progress / Pending
- Manual reconnect UX polish & production readiness (TASK008/TASK012 alignment)

## Upcoming / Backlog Ideas
1. Replace SensorTile sparkline placeholder with lightweight mini-chart.
2. Add error retry UX enhancements (auto-retry with backoff).
3. Persist custom video stream URL across app restarts (local storage).
4. Provide settings toggle for stale threshold & refresh cadence.
5. Add unit tests for `_coarsenTimestamp` logic.

## Risk / Notes
- Coarsening timestamps trades precision for stability‚Äîacceptable per requirement.
- Simulation mode logic remains coupled to notifier; could isolate for cleaner testability later.

## Metrics To Watch
- Service rebuild frequency post-config changes (should correlate only with Apply actions)
- MQTT reconnect latency after retire pattern adoption
- Video idle URL adoption correctness vs user-modified scenarios
