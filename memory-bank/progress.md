- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Formatting, analysis, testing, build verification
- [x] **Testing Procedure**: Comprehensive testing documentation and procedures

#### Cross-platform Support
- [x] **Web Application**: Primary platform
- [x] **Android Application**: Native mobile experience

### Features In Development üß± IN PROGRESS

#### Actuator Control System (Active)
- [x] **MQTT Commands**: Send control commands to devices via MQTT (`grow/{node}/actuator/set`)
- [x] **State Confirmation**: Verify actuator state changes via status feedback (`grow/+/actuator`, `grow/+/device`)
- [x] **Node Status Display**: Group devices by node with Online/Offline/Pending/Error badges; controls disabled when node Offline/Error
- [x] **Safety Systems**: Command pending -> timeout -> error handling; provider enforcement of node-online requirement (test hooks available)
- [x] **Testing**: Unit/provider tests for command/state transitions and node aggregation; Added integration test for actuator confirmation (task005)

#### Historical Data Analytics (Next)
- [ ] **Time-Series Charts**: Interactive charts using fl_chart package
- [ ] **InfluxDB Integration**: Historical sensor data queries with time ranges
- [ ] **Data Aggregation**: Multiple aggregation functions for different time scales
- [ ] **Time Range Controls**: User selectable ranges (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- [ ] **Chart Widgets**: Dashboard integration with historical visualization

#### Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] **MJPEG Stream Testing**: Complete video integration testing
- [ ] **Node Status Display**: Grouped actuator widgets by controlling node  
- [ ] **Full Stack Automation**: Playwright-based end-to-end testing
- [ ] **Dynamic device + sensor discovery**: Dynamically add sensor and device tiles when MQTT messages are received. Maybe create a cache for known devices/sensors to seed the app on a restart.
- [ ] **Refactor Dashboard page**: Change it to a sensor page display only. Keep the devices only on the device page.
- [ ] **Manual Reconnect (TASK008)**: Dashboard refresh button to trigger explicit MQTT + InfluxDB reconnection sequence with user feedback.

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Known Issues
- **Video Stream Testing**: MJPEG stream integration needs comprehensive testing validation

### Technical Debt Items  
- **Code Documentation**: Some utility functions need more comprehensive inline documentation
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: Widget tests could be expanded for edge cases and error scenarios
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings could be more streamlined

*Note: No blocking issues currently identified. All core functionality operational.*

## Development Metrics (Current)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 78+ tests passing (core business logic)
- **Integration Tests**: 11+ tests passing (end-to-end data flow) 
- **Widget Tests**: 3+ tests passing (UI component validation)
- **Error Handling Tests**: 4+ tests passing (failure scenario coverage)

### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: All flutter analyze checks passing
- **Formatting**: Consistent dart format applied throughout codebase
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clean Architecture principles maintained
- **Dependency Management**: All packages up-to-date and secure

### Future Roadmap

### Next Development Cycle (Priority Order)
1. **Actuator Control System**: MQTT command sending with state confirmation feedback
2. **Historical Data Charts**: Implement fl_chart time-series visualization with InfluxDB integration
3. **MJPEG Camera Streaming Test**: Robust testing for the MJPEG video feed
4. **Enhanced Testing**: Playwright automation for full-stack validation
