#### Decision A-002: Documentation Integration Approach  
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Status**: Pending  
**Context**: How to integrate Memory Bank with existing documentation  
**Options**: 
1. Replace existing docs (high risk)
2. Supplement existing docs (chosen approach)
3. Parallel documentation systems (maintenance overhead)
**Decision**: Supplement and enhance existing documentation structure

### Pending Decisions

#### PD-001: Documentation Automation Level
**Context**: How much to automate Memory Bank updates
**Timeline**: End of January 2025
**Options**:

- Semi-automation (assisted updates)
- Manual updates (current approach)

#### PD-002: Task Management Integration
**Context**: How to integrate Memory Bank tasks with GitHub Issues
**Timeline**: Early February 2025  
**Considerations**: Workflow efficiency vs. tool complexity

## Team Context

### Current Team Structure
- **Development Team**: Flutter development, testing, architecture
- **Infrastructure Team**: MQTT broker, InfluxDB, Docker deployment  
- **Domain Experts**: Hydroponic system knowledge, user requirements

### Knowledge Management
- **Onboarding**: Streamlined with comprehensive documentation
- **Context Sharing**: Memory Bank system enabling session independence

## Workflow Modes

### Plan Mode üìã
**When to use**: Before starting new development work or major changes  
**Purpose**: Ensure comprehensive planning and context alignment before implementation

**Workflow Process**:
1. **Context Review** (5-10 minutes)
   - Read activeContext.md for current development status
   - Review progress.md for project status and constraints  
   - Check tasks/_index.md for active and planned work

2. **Impact Assessment** (10-15 minutes)
   - Evaluate changes against systemPatterns.md architecture
   - Consider technology implications using techContext.md
   - Assess user experience impact via productContext.md

3. **Documentation Updates** (15-30 minutes)
   - Update activeContext.md with planned work details
   - Create task file in tasks/ folder with TASKID-name.md format
   - Update progress.md if milestones or roadmap affected

4. **Team Alignment** (5-15 minutes)
   - Get team review and approval for significant changes
   - Ensure no conflicts with other planned work
   - Confirm resource availability and timeline

**Exit Criteria**: Clear task definition, updated documentation, team alignment

### Act Mode ‚ö°
**When to use**: During active development and implementation  
**Purpose**: Maintain context and quality during execution while preserving knowledge

**Workflow Process**:

   - Update activeContext.md with daily progress notes
   - Document any technical decisions or trade-offs made

3. **Quality Assurance** (Per commit)
   - Run test suite before committing (./scripts/test-runner.sh --all)
   - Ensure code formatting (dart format .)
   - Validate build success (flutter analyze)

4. **Context Preservation** (As needed)
   - Document blockers, decisions, and learnings in task files
   - Update architecture documents if patterns change
   - Maintain real-time status for session independence

**Exit Criteria**: Feature complete, tests passing, documentation updated

### Review Mode üîç

**Purpose**: Consolidate learnings, update context, and plan next iteration

**Workflow Process**:
1. **Completion Documentation** (15-30 minutes)
   - Update progress.md with completed milestones and metrics
   - Move completed tasks from active to completed in tasks/_index.md
   - Document lessons learned and improvements in task files

2. **Context Currency** (20-40 minutes)
   - Review and update all Memory Bank documents for accuracy
   - Ensure architectural decisions are captured in systemPatterns.md
   - Update technology constraints in techContext.md if needed
   - Refresh activeContext.md with current development focus

3. **Quality Assessment** (10-20 minutes)
   - Review test coverage and quality metrics
   - Assess technical debt and maintenance needs
   - Validate all cross-references and document links

4. **Future Planning** (15-30 minutes)
