# Active Context

## High-Level Summary
- Runtime configuration (TASK010) implemented: settings persistence, dynamic MQTT/Influx rebuild with retire pattern, idle-safe MJPEG URL updates.
- Sensor page refactor (TASK009) complete (naming, stale badge, separated controls).

## Recently Completed
- TASK010: Dynamic settings (AppConfig + ConfigRepository + staged Apply), provider invalidation + manual reconnect integration, added tests.
- VideoState stabilization (no rebuild churn on config load; user-modified URL protection).

## Open Follow-Ups
- Manual reconnect UX polish & metrics (TASK008 refinement).
- Historical charts (TASK011).
- Production readiness hardening (TASK012) â€“ remove dummy Influx fallbacks.
- Config diff banner & batch apply (future TASK010 enhancement).

## Testing
- All suites passing: added config persistence tests, dynamic reconfiguration integration, updated video streaming tests to remove disposed notifier errors.
