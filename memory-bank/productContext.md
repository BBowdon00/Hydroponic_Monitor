# Product Context - Hydroponic Monitor

> **Project purpose, user experience goals, and problems addressed.**

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Hydroponic systems require continuous monitoring and control of multiple environmental parameters (water levels, temperature, humidity, pH, electrical conductivity) and actuators (pumps, fans, lighting, heating). Manual monitoring is time-intensive, error-prone, and prevents early detection of system issues that could damage crops or reduce yields.

### Current Pain Points
- **Manual Monitoring**: Requires physical presence to check sensor readings
- **Delayed Response**: Critical issues may go unnoticed for hours
- **Data Loss**: No historical tracking of environmental conditions
- **Control Complexity**: Managing multiple devices requires technical expertise
- **Accessibility**: System status not available when away from location
- **Integration Gaps**: Disparate sensors and controllers lack unified interface

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### Home Hydroponic Enthusiasts
- **Profile**: Hobbyists and small-scale growers
- **Technical Level**: Basic to intermediate
- **Primary Needs**: Simple monitoring, alerts, historical trends
- **Usage Patterns**: Daily check-ins, occasional adjustments
- **Pain Points**: Technical setup complexity, data interpretation

#### Educational Institutions
- **Profile**: Schools, universities with agricultural programs
- **Technical Level**: Varies (students to researchers)
- **Primary Needs**: Educational visibility, data collection, experimentation
- **Usage Patterns**: Classroom demonstrations, research projects
- **Pain Points**: System setup, student accessibility

## User Experience Goals

### Core UX Principles

#### Simplicity First
- **Dashboard Clarity**: Key information visible at a glance
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Reduce decision fatigue
