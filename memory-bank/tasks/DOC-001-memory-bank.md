- [x] Establish `tasks/` folder with `_index.md` and task management system
- [x] Include hierarchical relationships with mermaid diagrams
- [ ] Document key workflows (Plan Mode, Act Mode, Task Management)
- [ ] Validate all cross-references and document relationships
- [ ] Test documentation workflows with development team

## Dependencies
- None (foundational task)

```

### Content Strategy
- **Accuracy**: All content based on actual project state and existing documentation
- **Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of all project aspects
- **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and update processes
- **Accessibility**: Easy navigation and cross-referencing
- **Scalability**: Structure supports project growth and evolution

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Documents âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] `projectbrief.md`: 5,842 characters - comprehensive project scope
- [x] `productContext.md`: 8,681 characters - detailed UX and problem analysis  
- [x] `systemPatterns.md`: 11,209 characters - complete architecture documentation
- [x] `techContext.md`: 9,665 characters - full technology stack details
- [x] `activeContext.md`: 9,573 characters - current development context
- [x] `progress.md`: 12,895 characters - comprehensive status tracking

### Phase 2: Task Management âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] `tasks/` directory structure
- [x] `tasks/_index.md`: 7,059 characters - complete task management system
- [x] Sample task file (this document)

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS  
- [ ] Document Plan Mode workflow in activeContext.md
- [ ] Document Act Mode workflow in activeContext.md
- [ ] Document Review Mode workflow in activeContext.md
- [ ] Validate all cross-references work correctly
- [ ] Test workflow with development team

## Testing Requirements

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] All cross-references link to existing documents
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams render correctly in GitHub
- [ ] Content accuracy verified against actual project state
- [ ] No broken internal links or references

### Workflow Validation
- [ ] Plan Mode workflow tested with new feature planning
- [ ] Act Mode workflow tested with active development
- [ ] Review Mode workflow tested with completed milestone
- [ ] Task creation and management workflow tested

### Team Onboarding
- [ ] New team member can navigate documentation easily
- [ ] All necessary context available for session-independent work
- [ ] Documentation sufficient for technical decision making

## Current Blockers
None - all dependencies resolved and work proceeding on schedule.

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Content creation and documentation work
- **Medium Risk**: Ensuring all cross-references and links work correctly
- **Low Risk**: Team adoption of new documentation system

## Quality Assurance

### Review Checkpoints
1. **Content Accuracy**: All technical details match actual implementation
2. **Structure Completeness**: All required files and sections present
3. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: All document links and references work
4. **Workflow Validation**: All documented workflows tested and verified

### Success Metrics  
- **Completeness**: 100% of required documents created
