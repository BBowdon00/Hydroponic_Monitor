# TASK002 - Examine and Refactor Providers, Services, Streams, and Repositories

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-09-06  
**Updated:** 2025-09-06

## Original Request
Examine the provider, service, streams, and repositories (including files such as `sensor_repository.dart`, `device_repository.dart`, `mqtt_service.dart`, `influx_service.dart`, `data_providers.dart`, `connection_status_provider.dart`, `sensor_aggregation_providers.dart`, `connection_notification.dart`). Examine the full project thoroughly for architecture considerations and look for ways to simplify and consolidate code while removing redundancies. Keep the repository layer though - don't remove it entirely. All tests must pass afterwards - adjust the components that connect as necessary.

## Thought Process
- The project uses a layered architecture with providers, services, streams, and repositories.
- There may be overlap or redundancy between providers and services, or between streams and repositories.
- The repository layer is required and should not be removed, but can be refactored for clarity and efficiency.
- All changes must maintain passing tests, so test coverage and integration points must be considered.
- The files listed are likely the main touchpoints for data flow and state management.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review all listed files and their relationships (providers, services, streams, repositories).
- [ ] Search for and identify other files in the project that are relevant to architecture, data flow, or state management.
- [ ] Map out the current architecture and identify areas of overlap or redundancy.
- [ ] Propose a simplified architecture, consolidating code where possible.
- [ ] Refactor code to remove unnecessary duplication, keeping the repository layer.
- [ ] Update any components that connect to the refactored code (providers, services, etc.).
- [ ] Run all tests and ensure they pass; adjust tests if needed for refactored code.
- [ ] Document architectural changes and rationale in the Memory Bank.
