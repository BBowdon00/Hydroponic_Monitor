# TASK001 - Memory Bank Documentation System

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-09-06  
**Updated:** 2025-09-06

## Original Request
Establish the Memory Bank documentation system to enable robust, session-independent project continuity. This foundational task creates the complete documentation structure with detailed content covering all aspects of the Hydroponic Monitor project.

## Thought Process
The Memory Bank system is crucial for AI continuity across sessions. Since my memory resets completely between sessions, I need comprehensive documentation that serves as the single source of truth for understanding the project state, architecture, and current work focus.

The approach involves creating a hierarchical documentation structure where core files build upon each other:
- `projectbrief.md` as the foundation document
- Context files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) providing specialized knowledge
- Active tracking files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) maintaining current state
- Task management system for granular work tracking

This structure ensures that after any memory reset, I can quickly rebuild complete project understanding by reading through the Memory Bank files in their logical hierarchy.

## Implementation Plan
- Create memory-bank directory structure at repository root
- Implement core documentation files with comprehensive content
- Establish task management system with proper indexing
- Document hierarchical relationships and cross-references
- Validate all content accuracy against actual project state
- Integrate with existing project documentation

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 90%
