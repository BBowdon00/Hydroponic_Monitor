# TASK003 - Integrate Testing Procedure into Memory Bank

**Status:** Completed ✅  
**Added:** 2025-09-06  
**Updated:** 2025-09-06

## Original Request
Integrate a testing procedure into the memory bank. This involves reviewing all documentation in the memory bank on testing procedure, updating references to point to the new file, and generating a clean, step-by-step way to run all the tests and examine results.

## Thought Process
- The memory bank should have a single, clear source of truth for testing procedures.
- All documentation and references in the memory bank must be updated to point to the new testing procedure file.
- The testing procedure should be easy to follow, covering setup, running tests, and reviewing results.
- The process should work for all test types (unit, integration, widget, etc.) and be maintainable.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Review all memory bank documentation for existing testing procedure references.
- [x] Review entire repository for testing scripts and workflows
- [x] Create a new testing procedure file in the memory bank (e.g., `testing-procedure.md`).
- [x] Write a step-by-step guide for running all tests and examining results.
- [x] Update all memory bank documentation to reference the new testing procedure file.
- [x] Validate the procedure by running all tests and confirming results are easy to access.
- [x] Document any changes or decisions in the progress log.

**Overall Status:** Completed ✅ - 100%
