## Task Workflow

### Task Lifecycle
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> NotStarted : Task Created
    NotStarted --> InProgress : Development Begins
    InProgress --> Complete : Acceptance Criteria Met
    InProgress --> Blocked : Dependencies/Issues
    InProgress --> OnHold : Paused
    Blocked --> InProgress : Dependencies Resolved  
    OnHold --> InProgress : Resumed
    Complete --> [*] : Task Archived
```

### Task Creation Process
1. **Identify Need**: Task identified during planning or development
2. **Create Task File**: Use template to create `TASKID-taskname.md`
3. **Update Index**: Add task to appropriate section in this index
4. **Assign Owner**: Assign task to team member or team
5. **Set Priority**: Determine priority and due date
6. **Begin Work**: Update status to In Progress when work begins

### Task Completion Process  
1. **Complete Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure all criteria met
2. **Update Task File**: Document completion and any notes
3. **Update Index**: Move task to completed section
4. **Archive if Needed**: Move old tasks to archive folder if necessary

## Reporting and Metrics

### Current Sprint Status
```yaml
Active Tasks: 3
In Progress: 1 (DOC-001)
